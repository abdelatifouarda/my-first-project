# Breast Cancer Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple data analysis and machine learning project completed during my data analysis classes.
The goal of the project is to explore and understand a breast cancer dataset, clean the data, visualize important patterns,
and apply a basic machine learning model for classification.

This project focuses mainly on practicing **data analysis fundamentals** rather than building complex models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas (Data Cleaning & Data Manipulation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Dataset**, which contains medical features related to tumor characteristics.
The target variable indicates whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant**.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding
- Exploring dataset structure
- Checking data types and missing values
- Understanding feature distributions

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Converting columns to numeric format
- Handling missing values using median imputation
- Removing non-informative columns

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing feature distributions
- Analyzing correlations between features
- Identifying important relationships with the target variable

### 4. Data Visualization
- Histograms for feature distribution
- Correlation heatmap to understand relationships between variables

### 5. Machine Learning
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy

---

## 📊 Key Observations
- Some features show strong correlation with cancer diagnosis.
- Proper data cleaning improves model reliability.
- A basic KNN model can achieve reasonable accuracy on this dataset.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to strengthen my skills in:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization
- Applying basic machine learning models

This project represents a **learning-focused analysis**, not a production-level system.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add feature scaling before applying KNN
- Compare multiple machine learning models
- Improve visualizations with deeper insights
- Add detailed interpretation for each visualization
